Higher Diploma in Arts in Psychology\\n\\u201c After completing the two-year Higher Diploma in Psychology, I\\u00a0felt I had an excellent \\nbasis for moving forward with a career in psychology, as well as being able to apply the \\ntechniques and methodologies from the course in my current career. It has also opened \\nthe door to a number of related fields in work such as HR.\\nThe broad basis of the course gave me a good overview of the subject and of where my \\nstrengths and interests would lie for future study in psychology.\\nI really enjoyed the structure of the course and, although it is a significant time and effort \\ncommitment, I felt it was really worth it. The fact that it is accredited by the Psychology \\nSociety of Ireland (PSI) is a major bonus, meaning that your qualification will be recognised. \\nI felt there was a very good balance of continuous assessment, group and project work \\nalongside examinations, and I found the lecturers approachable and friendly.\\nFor me, the best thing about the course was meeting fellow students from a diverse \\nrange of backgrounds and forming firm friendships.\\\"2\\nPostgraduate Programmes\\nWhy Study for a Postgraduate  \\nQualification?Reputation as Ireland\\u2019s \\nLeading Independent College\\nDublin Business School (DBS) is \\nIreland\\u2019s largest independent \\nthird-level college.

The National \\nFramework of Qualifications relates all \\neducation and training awards made in \\nIreland to each other and establishes \\nclearly defined standards about the \\nquality of awards and what a student \\nshould be expected to achieve for each \\naward. The Framework also allows Irish \\nqualifications to be compared more \\neasily and accurately with those of other \\ncountries. This is particularly important in a European context where there have \\nbeen significant moves towards greater \\ncompatibility and comparability of \\nqualifications.\\nThe National Framework of Qualifications \\ncomprises ten levels, with each level \\nbased on specified standards of \\nknowledge, skill and competence. Awards \\nat Levels 6 to 10 are made by QQI and \\nthe Irish Universities. At undergraduate \\nlevel, DBS offers courses leading to QQI \\nawards at Level 6 (Higher Certificate), \\nLevel 7 (Ordinary Bachelor Degree) and \\nLevel 8 (Honours Bachelor Degree).

The \\nApplied Research Project, Dissertation \\nor Placement will bring together and \\nsynthesise learning from other modules, \\ncombining research and technical skills \\nto investigate, design, produce and \\ncritically evaluate an area of research \\ninterest.\\nThis programme is offered as a part-time \\ndelivery with a recommended learning \\npath that allows completion within a \\nminimum two-year period. It is similar to \\nthe full-time programme, and is divided \\ninto four stages rather than three. In \\nstage one of the part-time delivery, \\nstudents will follow similar aims to the \\nfull-time programme. They will complete the modules Global Supply Chain and \\nLogistics Management, Procurement \\nand Inventory in Supply Chain \\nManagement and Research methods 1. \\nIn stage two of the programme, students \\nwill study Strategic and Sustainable \\nSupply Chain Management, Strategic \\nInformation Systems, and Research \\nMethods 2. Stage three of the part-\\ntime delivery has just two modules: \\nOperations and Analytics in Supply \\nChain Management and Innovation \\nand Disruptive T echnologies. Finally in \\nstage four of the programme students \\nwill complete either their Dissertation, \\nApplied Research Project or Placement.\\nT eaching and Assessment\\nThe programme will be structured \\nin a blended format consisting of \\nsynchronous online and on-demand \\ndelivery.\\nThe blended online delivery allows for \\nthe most appropriate mode of delivery \\nto be applied to different parts of the \\nsyllabus. Typically, the more theoretical \\ncontent would be delivered through the \\non-demand mode, with the discursive \\naspects of the syllabus more inclined \\nto be delivered in the synchronous \\nonline mode. Although, such discursive \\ntopics can also be considered in an \\nin-class setting. The more practical \\nand assessment-driven parts of the \\nsyllabus can also be reserved for the \\nin-class time. Instruction on using \\nthe tools and technologies for data \\nanalytics can be delivered in class. \\nFormative assessment exercises can \\nbe set in any mode to allow the learners \\nto assess progress. Peer review of \\nthese formative assessments can help \\ndrive this development, which can take \\nplace through asynchronous discussion \\nboards or in-class or online discussions. \\nThe blended approach will also avail \\nof directed e-learning objects, such \\nas annotated case studies, videos \\nand reading.Entry Requirements\\nThis programme is aimed at learners \\nwith a Level 8 honours bachelor\\u2019s \\nprimary undergraduate degree, or \\nHigher Diploma, in a cognate area \\n(e.g. computer science, IT , science, \\nmathematics, statistics, finance, \\neconomics, business (including \\nquantitative methods), engineering, \\nmaths and management information \\nsystems), who wish to specialise in \\nthe field of supply chain management \\nwith a view to entering the industry, or \\nthose with a Level 8 honours bachelor\\u2019s \\nprimary undergraduate degree, or \\nHigher Diploma, in a non-cognate area \\nplus three to five years\\u2019 experience of \\nlogistics or supply chain management \\nand who require a qualification \\nin this area in order to progress \\nprofessionally.
